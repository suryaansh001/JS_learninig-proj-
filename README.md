** Snake, Water, Gun Game

**This is a simple Snake, Water, Gun game built using JavaScript. It simulates a hand gesture recognition game where the user competes against the computer. The user makes a gesture, and the computer randomly chooses a gesture, and the game decides the winner based on the classic rules:

- Snake beats Water
- Water beats Gun
- Gun beats Snake

## Features
